# Layering Instructions Feature - Backend Implementation

## Overview

The Look Creator tool now supports two modes for layering products on models:
- **Simple Mode**: Uses a default layering instruction
- **Advanced Mode**: Uses a customizable layering instruction template

## Backend Changes

### 1. Database Schema (No Migration Required)

The `user_settings` table already has a `tool_settings` JSON column. Two new fields have been added to the `lookCreator` object within this JSON:

```json
{
  "toolSettings": {
    "lookCreator": {
      "systemPrompt": "...",
      "sceneDescriptions": {...},
      "simpleLayeringInstruction": "...",      // NEW
      "advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate": "..." // NEW
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Pydantic Schema Updates

**File:** `app/schemas/settings.py`

Updated `LookCreatorSettings` to include:
```python
class LookCreatorSettings(BaseModel):
    systemPrompt: str
    sceneDescriptions: SceneDescriptions
    simpleLayeringInstruction: str  # NEW
    advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate: str  # NEW
```

### 3. Default Settings

**File:** `app/core/default_settings.py`

```python
"lookCreator": {
    # ... existing fields ...
    "simpleLayeringInstruction": "Layer the products from bottom to top in the order they were provided, starting with foundational pieces (e.g., pants, skirts) and ending with outer layers (e.g., jackets, coats).",
    "advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate": "Layer the products according to the following custom instruction: {custom_instruction}"
}
```

### 4. Data Migration

All existing user settings have been automatically migrated to include these two new fields with their default values.

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/v1/settings

**Response includes the new fields:**

```json
{
  "theme": "light",
  "toolSettings": {
    "lookCreator": {
      "systemPrompt": "Your primary directive is to create...",
      "sceneDescriptions": {
        "studio": "...",
        "beach": "...",
        "city": "...",
        "forest": "..."
      },
      "simpleLayeringInstruction": "Layer the products from bottom to top...",
      "advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate": "Layer the products according to: {custom_instruction}"
    },
    "copywriter": {...},
    "finishingStudio": {...},
    "modelManager": {...}
  }
}
```

### PUT /api/v1/settings

**Request body accepts the new fields:**

```json
{
  "theme": "light",
  "toolSettings": {
    "lookCreator": {
      "systemPrompt": "...",
      "sceneDescriptions": {...},
      "simpleLayeringInstruction": "Your custom simple instruction",
      "advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate": "Your custom template with {custom_instruction}"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

### POST /api/v1/settings/reset

Resets all settings including the two new layering instruction fields to their default values.

## Validation

Both fields are **required** and must have at least 1 character:
- `simpleLayeringInstruction`: min_length=1
- `advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate`: min_length=1

Pydantic automatically validates these constraints on all API operations.

## Frontend Integration

### Simple Mode

1. Fetch settings via `GET /api/v1/settings`
2. Use `toolSettings.lookCreator.simpleLayeringInstruction` directly
3. No user editing required in Simple Mode

### Advanced Mode

1. User can customize `toolSettings.lookCreator.advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate` in Settings page
2. The template should contain `{custom_instruction}` placeholder
3. Frontend replaces `{custom_instruction}` with user's actual instruction at runtime
4. Save via `PUT /api/v1/settings`

## Example Usage

**Simple Mode:**
```javascript
const settings = await getSettings();
const instruction = settings.toolSettings.lookCreator.simpleLayeringInstruction;
// Use: "Layer the products from bottom to top in the order they were provided..."
```

**Advanced Mode:**
```javascript
const settings = await getSettings();
const template = settings.toolSettings.lookCreator.advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate;
const userInstruction = "Put the jacket on top, then add accessories";
const finalInstruction = template.replace('{custom_instruction}', userInstruction);
// Use: "Layer the products according to the following custom instruction: Put the jacket on top, then add accessories"
```

## Migration Status

âœ… Existing users: Automatically migrated (1 user updated)  
âœ… New users: Will receive defaults automatically  
âœ… Backend: Restarted and running (PID: 21976)  
âœ… All API endpoints: Updated and validated  

## Testing

Test the new fields with:

```bash
# Get settings
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://your-domain.ngrok-free.dev/AIStudio/api/v1/settings

# Update settings
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "theme": "light",
    "toolSettings": {
      "lookCreator": {
        ...
        "simpleLayeringInstruction": "Custom simple instruction",
        "advancedLayeringInstructionTemplate": "Custom template {custom_instruction}"
      }
    }
  }' \
  https://your-domain.ngrok-free.dev/AIStudio/api/v1/settings

# Reset to defaults
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://your-domain.ngrok-free.dev/AIStudio/api/v1/settings/reset
```

## Summary

âœ… Two new fields added to Look Creator settings  
âœ… Database schema updated (JSON field)  
âœ… Pydantic validation enforces required fields  
âœ… Default values configured  
âœ… Existing user data migrated  
âœ… All API endpoints support new fields  
âœ… Backend restarted and ready  

**The backend is fully ready for frontend integration!** ðŸš€

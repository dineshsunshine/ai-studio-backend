- New field: `associatedLooks: LookBasic[]`
- Returns lightweight look info for each video job

**GET /api/v1/video-jobs/{jobId}** (Detail)
- New field: `associatedLooks: LookBasic[]`
- Full video details with associated looks

### Look Fields

| Field | Type | Description |

| `id` | string | Look ID |
| `title` | string | Look title/name |
| `generatedImageUrl` | string or null | Look cover image URL |

### Frontend Use Cases

1. **In video list**: Show look thumbnail or title next to video
2. **In video detail**: Display all associated looks (one video can have multiple looks)
3. **Link looks and videos**: Show user which looks this video is generated from

### Example Usage

```
List videos → Show video + associated look thumbnail
Detail view → Display all looks used to create this video
```

### Notes
- `associatedLooks` can be empty (video not yet linked to looks)
- `generatedImageUrl` may be null if look hasn't been rendered
- Use look ID to fetch full look details if needed
- Video can be associated with 0 or more looks
